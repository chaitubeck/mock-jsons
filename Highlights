	1.	Real-Time Data Integration
Pulls from live APIs and backend systems in real-time — ensuring the prescriber or pharmacist always sees the most current order, PA, and communication details.
	2.	Multi-Agent Routing Intelligence
Dynamically routes user questions to the correct backend (orders, PA, shipments, communications) based on intent — without static rules or human triage.
	3.	Clinical Decision Support with Structured Logic
Order summaries are generated using rule-based urgency, status classification, and recommended action models — eliminating hallucinations and inconsistencies.
	4.	Context-Aware Natural Language Generation
Summaries and chat responses are tailored for healthcare users — removing system jargon and focusing on actionable next steps.
	5.	Embedded Experience, Not a Separate Tool
Everything is surfaced inline within the workflow — no separate search, navigation, or login required. It feels like an extension of the application, not an external assistant.
	6.	RAG-Based and Extensible by Design
Uses Retrieval-Augmented Generation for grounded answers. Modular architecture supports easy expansion to new data sources and business rules.
	7.	Performance Optimized for Scalability
Delivers responses in under 5 seconds with token-optimized prompts and optional caching — scalable to 100k+ queries per day.
	8.	Designed for Human Roles
Summaries prioritize clarity for doctors, pharmacists, and case managers — not just raw data. Responses are immediately actionable.
	9.	Secure & Governed
Integrated into enterprise authentication and audit frameworks. Sensitive data is passed securely via governed API contracts.
